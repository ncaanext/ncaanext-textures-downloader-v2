## Features <a name="features">

The NCAA NEXT mod requires a massive folder of replacement textures. This app helps manage the installation and upkeep of those textures. 

### Mod Installer <a name="introduction--installer">

The **First Time Setup** uses Git sparse checkout to efficiently download only the texture files you need (not the entire repository). This is faster and more reliable than downloading a massive zip file, which can fail or become corrupted. The installer automatically places textures in the correct location within your emulator's textures folder.

### Mod Updater <a name="introduction--updater">

The **Sync** feature keeps your textures up-to-date with two modes:

- **Download New Content** (Incremental Sync): Quickly grabs only the changes since your last sync. Uses the GitHub Compare API to identify new, modified, renamed, and deleted files.

- **Full Sync**: Compares every local file against the repository using SHA hash verification. Use this occasionally or when experiencing texture issues.

Both modes will:
- Download new and modified files
- Rename/move files that were reorganized
- Delete files that were removed from the project
- Preserve your disabled textures (dash-prefixed files)
- Never touch your `user-customs` folder

### Post-Sync Verification <a name="introduction--verification">

After every sync, the app performs a quick file count verification to ensure your local installation matches the repository. If a mismatch is detected, you'll be prompted to run a Full Sync to resolve discrepancies.

## Handling User-Custom Textures <a name="custom-textures">

This app is designed with texture customization in mind:

### The `user-customs` Folder

Put all of your custom textures in the `user-customs` folder (inside the `replacements` folder). **The app will never modify, update, or delete anything in this folder.** This is the safe place for your personal textures and DLC content.

### Disabling Default Textures

When using custom textures, you need to disable the mod's default texture so yours takes precedence. To do this:

1. **Keep the default texture in place** (don't delete it)
2. **Prepend the filename with a dash** (e.g., rename `3a30272f374c5d47.png` to `-3a30272f374c5d47.png`)

The dash prefix "disables" the texture - the emulator ignores it, but the app still recognizes it. When the mod team updates that texture, **your disabled version will be updated too**, keeping you in sync without breaking your custom texture.

**Important**: If you delete the default texture instead of disabling it, the sync will re-download it and potentially cause conflicts with your custom texture.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### Windows <a name="installation--windows"></a>

1. Download `windows-portable.zip` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest)
2. Extract the zip file somewhere on your computer (e.g., `C:\Apps\` or your Desktop)
3. Open the extracted folder and run the `.exe` file to launch the app

**Note**: The app includes a bundled copy of Git (MinGit), so you don't need to install Git separately.

#### Updating the App (Windows)

1. Download the new `windows-portable.zip` from the latest release
2. Extract and replace the existing app folder
3. Your settings (including GitHub API token) are stored separately and will be preserved

### macOS <a name="installation--macos"></a>

1. Download the Mac installer file from the [latest release](../../releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG and drag the app to your Applications folder
3. On first launch, right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper. In some cases you might need to go to Setting > Privacy & Security, scroll down, and allow the app to run in the Security settings section.

#### Updating the App (macOS)

Simply download the new `.dmg` and drag the app to your Applications folder, replacing the old version. Your settings are stored in your user Library folder and will be preserved.

## Using the App <a name="usage"></a>

### First Time Textures Installation <a name="usage--setup">

1. Select the **Install** tab
2. Browse to your PCSX2 textures folder. You can find the exact path in PCSX2 (or AetherSX2) at Settings > Graphics > Texture Replacements.
3. Click **Start Installation**
4. Wait for the download to complete (this may take a while for large texture packs)

The installer uses Git sparse checkout to efficiently download only the texture files. Progress is displayed in real-time. 

**Requirements for Mac Users Only**: Git must be installed. If you don't have it, install Xcode Command Line Tools by running in Terminal:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Updating and Syncing <a name="usage--sync">

1. Select the **Sync** tab
2. Ensure your GitHub API Token is configured (instructions below)
3. Choose your sync mode:
   - **Download New Content**: Fast, only downloads changes since last sync (recommended for regular use)
   - **Full Sync**: Compares all files, slower but thorough (use occasionally or when troubleshooting)
4. Click **Run Sync**

**Warning Dialogs**: When running a Full Sync, if files will be replaced or deleted, you'll see a warning dialog listing the affected files. This gives you a chance to back up any custom textures to the `user-customs` folder before proceeding.

#### GitHub API Token (Required for Sync)

A GitHub Personal Access Token is required for the sync features. Here's how to get one:

1. Create a free Github account, if needed, and generate a "Fine-Grained" API token. Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-Grained Tokens > [Generate New Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new?name=Textures+Downloader&description=Token+for+syncing+textures&expires_in=365).
2. Give it a name (e.g., "NCAA NEXT Textures")
3. Set expiration to 1 year (maximum)
4. **No permissions are needed** - leave everything unchecked
5. Click "Generate Token" and copy it
6. Paste the token into the app's GitHub API Token field and click Save.
